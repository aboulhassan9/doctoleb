# DoctoLeb — Secure Web V1 Plan

> **Milestone**: Production-safe web dashboard for **one specific clinic with multiple doctors**
> **Status**: Phase 1-3 complete — **migrations APPLIED to live DB** ✅
> **Last verified against live DB / functions**: 2026-05-04
> **Supabase project**: `gezmfmskhmjgnquoyosq` (clinic-website)

## ✅ DB Migrations Deployed (2026-05-03)

All 9 migration batches applied successfully to live DB:
1. `secure_web_v1_foundation` — auth_user_id column, helper functions
2. `secure_web_v1_timestamps_constraints` — timestamptz, status CHECK constraints
3. `secure_web_v1_audit_softdelete` — audit_log table, soft-delete columns, audit triggers
4. `secure_web_v1_triggers_rpcs_views` — sign-up trigger, update_patient_profile RPC, views
5. `secure_web_v1_rpcs_hardening_v2` — book_slot, cancel_appointment, get_next_appointment hardened
6. `secure_web_v1_rls_policies_part1-4` — 35+ role-scoped RLS policies replacing old permissive ones
7. `revoke_anon_execute_on_helpers` — revoked anon access to all SECURITY DEFINER functions

## ⚠️ Remaining Manual Action
- **Enable leaked password protection** in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings → Security
- **Optional cleanup:** remove the safe `auth` edge function only if `/auth/profile` is not needed. Verified 2026-05-04: old `auth-signin` and `create-users` functions return `NOT_FOUND`; deployed `auth/register` returns `410` and does not create users.

---

## V1 Success Criteria

- [x] No plaintext/custom auth path remains (auth.js rewritten, `public.users.password_hash` dropped)
- [x] **No `USING (true)` / `WITH CHECK (true)` RLS bypass** — 35+ scoped policies deployed
- [x] **`clinic_settings` has RLS enabled** — deployed
- [x] **3 SECURITY DEFINER views fixed** — `security_invoker = true`
- [x] **All functions search_path fixed** — `SET search_path = public, pg_temp`
- [x] **Anon-callable RPCs locked** — REVOKE EXECUTE on all helpers + RPCs from anon
- [x] **Wildcard selects fixed** — 5 services no longer expose sensitive auth fields through joins
- [x] **Hard-deletes replaced with soft-delete** — patients, reports, certificates
- [x] **RULE 5 compliance** — 0 pages import `supabase` directly (was 4)
- [x] **Notification schema mismatch fixed** — `related_type` stripped from inserts
- [x] **Precheck service expanded** — `getById`, `updateDraft` methods added
- [x] **[P0] update_patient_profile hardened** — auth.uid() ownership + staff check
- [x] **[P0] book_slot hardened** — auth.uid() check, patient ownership validation, atomic with reason/duration
- [x] **[P1] Patient appointment INSERT/UPDATE → staff-only** (must use book_slot/cancel_appointment RPCs)
- [x] **[P1] Notification INSERT → staff-only** (prevents cross-user write via public API)
- [x] **[P1] Booking partial-failure eliminated** — bookFromSlot now fully atomic through RPC
- [x] **[P2] Fallback sign-up rollback** — orphaned user row deleted if patient insert fails
- [x] **Stale book_slot(4-param) overload dropped** — only hardened 6-param version remains
- [ ] Booking, pre-check, notifications, patient profile work against real data
- [ ] No page renders fake medical data on failure
- [x] `npm run build` clean
- [ ] Role-based smoke test passes
- [ ] Leaked password protection enabled in Supabase Auth

## Product Scope Decision

DoctoLeb V1 is **not a SaaS marketplace** and is **not an open platform where any doctor can self-register**.

It is the operating system for one real clinic:
- Patients can register/login from the public site to manage their own profile and appointments.
- Doctors, predoctors, and secretaries are clinic staff accounts created through an internal trusted workflow.
- Multiple doctors can work inside the same clinic, but there is no tenant onboarding, subscription billing, public doctor marketplace, or multi-clinic switching in V1.
- Any future `admin` role means "clinic owner/manager", not "SaaS platform administrator".

This replaces the older "1 clinic / 1 doctor" assumption. Any service, RLS policy, route, or UI flow that assumes exactly one doctor must be treated as a V1 gap.

## New Modules Added (by prior agent session)

| Module | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `authIdentity` | `src/lib/authIdentity.js` | Session user resolution via `auth_user_id` FK, with email fallback |
| `selects` | `src/lib/selects.js` | Canonical SELECT field lists (explicit public profile fields only) |
| `time` | `src/lib/time.js` | `CLINIC_TIME_ZONE`, date/time parsing, formatting |
| `appointments` | `src/lib/appointments.js` | Status enum, state machine (`canTransitionAppointmentStatus`), normalizer |
| `routes` | `src/lib/routes.js` | Role → home route mapping |
| `schemas` | `src/schemas/index.js` | Zod schemas: auth, booking, patient profile, precheck |

---

## Phase 1 — Security & Auth Hardening

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| 1.1 | Deactivate insecure custom auth path | ✅ | Old `auth-signin` and `create-users` deployed function URLs return `NOT_FOUND`. Current `auth/register` returns `410` and does not create users. |
| 1.2 | Stop writing `password_hash` from frontend | ✅ | `auth.js` rewritten — uses Supabase Auth only. `public.users.password_hash` dropped live. |
| 1.3 | Fix AuthContext race conditions | ✅ | Proper `getSession()` → `getCurrentUser()` → `setLoading(false)`. Try/catch on `onAuthStateChange`. |
| 1.4 | Error handling on `logout()` | ✅ | Returns `{ success, error }`, clears state only on success. |
| 1.5 | `isSubmitting` guard on sign-in/sign-up | ✅ | `authActionInFlightRef` prevents double-click. |
| 1.6 | Session timeout (30min idle) | ✅ | `IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` in `AuthContext.jsx` with activity event listeners. |
| 1.7 | Enable leaked password protection | ❌ | Supabase dashboard setting — not yet toggled. |
| 1.8 | Forgot-password / reset-password flow | ✅ | `ResetPasswordPage.jsx` + `authService.requestPasswordReset()` + `resetPassword()`. |

**Phase 1 Progress: 7/8 ✅** — remaining: enable leaked PW protection

| 2.3 | Replace `WITH CHECK(true)` insert policies | ✅ | ❌ | `v1_policies.sql` — users (patient-only insert), doctors, clinics |
| 2.4 | Replace `USING(true)` update policies | ✅ | ❌ | `v1_policies.sql` — users (self or staff), doctors (self or staff) |
| 2.5 | Add policies to zero-policy tables | ✅ | ❌ | `v1_policies.sql` — certificates, precheck_forms, predoctors, referrals |
| 2.6 | Add INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE to partial tables | ✅ | ❌ | `v1_policies.sql` — consultations, medical_reports, payments |
| 2.7 | Fix 3 SECURITY DEFINER views | ✅ | ❌ | `v1_foundation.sql:385-458` — all 3 recreated with `security_invoker = true` |
| 2.8 | Fix mutable `search_path` on 6 functions | ✅ | ❌ | `v1_foundation.sql` — all functions now have `SET search_path = public, pg_temp` |
| 2.9 | Revoke anon EXECUTE on RPCs | ✅ | ❌ | `v1_foundation.sql:643-646` — `book_slot`, `get_available_slots` |
| 2.10 | Expand appointments CHECK constraint | ✅ | ❌ | `v1_foundation.sql:148-159` — 7 statuses including `pre_check`, `in_consultation` |

## Post-V1 Backlog (Deferred)

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| Clinic admin/manager UI | Staff management is needed later, but V1 can use trusted internal account creation while core flows stabilize |
| Mobile app (React Native) | Web must be stable first |
| TypeScript migration | Stabilize JS first |
| TanStack Query | Current fetching works |
| Dark mode rewrite | Defer to post-v1 |
| i18n (Arabic, French) | English-only for v1 |
| File uploads / Storage | No medical image upload in v1 |
| PDF generation | Defer to post-v1 |
| Email/SMS notifications | In-app only for v1 |
| Payment processing (Stripe) | CRUD billing only for v1 |
| Multi-clinic / SaaS tenant architecture | DoctoLeb V1 is for one specific clinic, not SaaS |
| CI/CD pipeline | Manual deploy for v1 |
| Error monitoring (Sentry) | Console-only for v1 |

---

## Assumptions & Defaults

1. **Live DB is source of truth** — when repo migrations and live schema disagree, live wins
2. **Single clinic / multiple doctors** for v1 — no SaaS tenants, no public doctor onboarding
3. **Minimal disruption** — preserve route structure, service names, component names
4. **Keep JS for v1** — no TypeScript conversion during stabilization
5. **Roles for v1**: `doctor`, `predoctor`, `secretary`, `patient` (`admin`/clinic manager deferred)
6. **Edge functions already deployed** — audit and fix in-place
